		<p class="intro">I was born on the island of Aruba in the year 1986. It was a
        delightful Sunday afternoon. I weighed somewhere around 8 lbs. </p>
        
		<p>I spent the first eight years of my life living in Aruba. I grew up
        speaking Dutch and learned English by watching TV. Some of the shows I 
        watched are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saved by the Bell</li>
          <li>Mickey Mouse Club</li>
          <li>Doug</li>
          <li>Rugrats</li>
        </ul>  
        
		
        <p>When I was eight my family moved to Bolivia.
        The first few months in Bolivia were really difficult for me. 
        Once school started I had a hard time communicating with my classmates.
        I spoke no Spanish at the time, and my English left much to be desired.
        I was constantly accidentally using Dutch words. Eventually, I made friends
        and everything was great!</p>
